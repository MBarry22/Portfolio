                <p>Hello there!. My name is Mason Porter, I am a 20 year old software developer currently enrolled in "Software Systems Development" at British Columbia Institute of Technology.
                   My knowledge of software has improved drastically over the past year and a half with learning the fundamentals of many languages such as C#, React, .NET, JavaScript, NodeJS, 
                   ExpressJS, HTML, CSS, and more. With that I have also gotten to spend time with databases such as SQL, MYSQL, SQLITE and MongoDB. 
                </p>
